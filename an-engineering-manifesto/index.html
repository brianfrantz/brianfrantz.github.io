                <p>When I took over as Vice President of Engineering here at Ticketleap, in some ways things didn't change at all, but in other ways there was a major transition for me to go through.</p>

<p>To a large extent I was already doing a big chunk of the job as the Software Architect (if that was really my job title - who can remember? - I've had so many over the years).  I knew the product, the team, and the codebase really well.  Our process was well established and we were operating really well as a team.</p>

<p>The hard part of the transition for me was the shift in focus.  I needed to shift away from a code-based focus and more toward a team-based focus.  I was suddenly responsible for the success of the individuals on my team as well as the team itself.  I also became responsible for communicating with the management team and the rest of the company.</p>

<p>As the spokesman for engineering in management meetings, I needed to be able to communicate how our team builds software and the reasons why we do what we do.  Our team is tight-knit and loud.  We have inside jokes and throw things around the office.  We are strong-willed and uncompromising when it comes to the quality of our product.  Sometimes this could be interpreted as if we were arrogant or prima-donnas.  Suddenly it was my job to explain the team and our methods to the rest of the company.</p>

<p>Many times I get tongue-tied in meetings and can't get my point across the way I'd like.  In this case I decided I'd write up a document with the Ticketleap way of building software.  I've included it below.  I don't think I've seen any other documents like this one floating around the internet, but they are probably out there.  Hopefully this will help some software teams out there with developing their own way of doing things.  Many of the stuff in the document I consider mandatory for a good software team, but other stuff is just how Ticketleap has evolved to do things over the years.</p>

<p>Feel free to take this and use it as you will.  I hope you find it informative and useful...</p>

<h3 id="theticketleapengineeringmanifesto">The Ticketleap Engineering Manifesto</h3>

<p>Ticketleap is on a mission to create a world where more people experience more events.  We aim to do this by identifying barriers to throwing and attending events and eliminating them.  Our software is the largest component of our efforts to remove these barriers.  As our software goes, so goes Ticketleap.</p>

<p>Quality is the overall guiding principle of our engineering team.  Quality in the sense that our product is not buggy.  Quality in the sense that our user experience feels right.  Quality in the sense that our solution to a problem actually solves the problem.  When we do things right, our users should feel delighted by the effectiveness and the experience of using our applications.</p>

<p>Attaining these goals is all about our people.  Building a great application is only tangentially related to technology.  Primarily it is the skills, the experience, the collaboration, and the passion of our team that enables us to build great products.</p>

<p>Everything that follows is just details - knowledge we have gained over the years, largely through trial and error and experience.  These details may change over time as we learn more, but quality will always be our goal and our people will always be the bedrock of all that we do.</p>

<h4 id="thedetails">The Details</h4>

<p>Each of us succeeds or fails together as a team.  Everyone’s input matters - we give honest, open, and constructive feedback on every aspect of our process and our team.  There are arguments and there is passionate disagreement, but there is also a strong feeling that everyone is driving in the same direction and is in this together.  We make mistakes, but we make them as a team without blame, we learn from them, and we aren’t afraid to reset and make the right decision going forward.</p>

<p>Our team works at a sustainable pace and strives for stable productivity.  We don’t burn out.   We work our asses off during normal working hours, then go home to enjoy our home lives.  The next day we come back energized and ready to go.</p>

<p>We are always learning and teaching.   There is always more to learn and there is always an opportunity to improve both ourselves and our process.  We continuously aim to eliminate barriers, to make our efforts more efficient, and to make our software better.  We don’t have fiefdoms and we don’t have knowledge silos.  Any of us can go on vacation and know that progress will continue without the need to call someone at the beach.</p>

<p>Management builds the team by finding a good mix of professionals, giving them what they need to do their jobs, and then getting out of the way.  Experience counts.  We feel that when you hire amateurs or treat professionals as amateurs, you will get an amateur level product.  When hiring we look for folks that have shipped successful products in their careers (regardless of the programming language or tools they used).  Once onboard, we treat them right by respecting their knowledge, trusting their integrity, and providing the tools they need to efficiently do their jobs.  Management provides constant feedback and eliminates any barriers that may obstruct the success of the team.</p>

<p>We will not ship shit.  We build our products the right way.  We are professionals that have customers that count on us - cowboy coding is not an option.  We build for the future - for maintainability and stability.  We don’t use a new technology just for the sake of using a new technology.  Development speed is important, but not at the expense of quality.  Our developers have the goal that QA will find nothing (though we haven’t mastered that yet).  Our QA team has the goal of finding everything (though we haven’t mastered that yet either).  We believe that nothing is done until it is in the hands of our customers.  </p>

<p>We think things through but understand that change is inevitable.  We bite off manageable chunks of work and discuss and plan them as a group.  This allows us to make explicit well-informed decisions rather than implicit off-the-cuff decisions, and it allows us to respond quickly to change.  We make honest estimates.  Each of us are allowed and expected to say “No” when “No” is the correct answer.  The team sets its own scope and deadlines, so we consider our estimates to be a team commitment.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly we have fun and don’t take ourselves too seriously.  We enjoy each other’s company.  Coming to work in the morning isn’t a chore.  We believe that a team that has fun together will produce a better product.  Beware - at any time jokes and/or bouncy balls may be flying. </p>
